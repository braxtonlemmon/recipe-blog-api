      p.outro As mentioned on the website, you will receive one email every week featuring a new recipe. If you haven't followed a recipe on Peel the Garlic yet, you're in for a treat. 
    
      p.outro Ingredients and recipe instructions are clickable, allowing you to keep track of your progress. If you are working on a tablet-sized screen or larger, the list of ingredients will remain fixed on the screen, preventing the need to continuously scroll up and down to toggle between ingredients and instructions.
      
      p.outro If you have any questions or suggestions about anything (recipes, the site, my writing), don't hesitate to contact me! Again, welcome to the site. I hope you find something you enjoy.
